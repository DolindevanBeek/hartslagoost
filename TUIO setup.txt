1. Within the project folder, run 'nvm use v5.12.0' and node src/server.js to start the server that listens to Reactivation & converts the information to JS. (It needs an older version of node to start)
2. Run reactivision: downloads/reactivision-1.5.x/macosx/reactivision.xcodeproj & run with Xcode (both cameras just work if you attach them with usb, the camera.xml file has the right settings)
3. Open up the index.html file
